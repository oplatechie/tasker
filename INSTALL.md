# Installation Guide

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd obsidian-task-plugin
npm install
```

### Step 2: Build the Plugin

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the `main.js` file needed by Obsidian.

### Step 3: Install in Obsidian

#### Option A: Development Installation (Recommended for Testing)

1. Create a test vault or use an existing one
2. Navigate to your vault's plugins directory:
   ```
   YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/
   ```
3. Create a new directory called `task-manager`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /path/to/YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/task-manager
   ```
4. Copy the following files to the `task-manager` directory:
   - `main.js` (generated by build)
   - `manifest.json`
   - `styles.css`

   ```bash
   cp main.js manifest.json styles.css /path/to/YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/task-manager/
   ```

5. Reload Obsidian:
   - Press `Ctrl/Cmd + R` to reload
   - Or restart Obsidian completely

6. Enable the plugin:
   - Go to Settings → Community Plugins
   - Find "Task Manager" in the list
   - Toggle it on

#### Option B: Symbolic Link (Best for Development)

If you're actively developing the plugin, create a symbolic link:

```bash
# Create symlink (adjust paths as needed)
ln -s /path/to/obsidian-task-plugin /path/to/YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/task-manager
```

Then run in watch mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will automatically rebuild when you make changes.

### Step 4: Set Up Your Tasks File

1. Create a `tasks.md` file in your vault root (or any location you prefer)
2. Copy the example tasks from the provided `tasks.md` file, or start fresh
3. Configure the plugin:
   - Go to Settings → Task Manager
   - Set the path to your tasks file (default: `tasks.md`)
   - Set your task identifier (default: `#tlog`)

### Step 5: Open the Task Manager

- Click the checkmark icon (✓) in the left ribbon, or
- Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and type "Open Task Manager"

## Development Workflow

### Watch Mode

For active development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will watch for changes and rebuild automatically.

### Production Build

For a final build:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Making Changes

1. Edit the TypeScript files (`main.ts`, etc.)
2. The dev server will automatically rebuild
3. Reload Obsidian to see changes:
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + R` (reload)
   - Or use the Command Palette: "Reload app without saving"

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Showing Up

- Make sure you've enabled "Community plugins" in Obsidian settings
- Check that all three files are in the correct directory
- Try reloading Obsidian with `Ctrl/Cmd + R`

### Build Errors

If you get build errors:

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Plugin Not Working

1. Open the Developer Console:
   - `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac)
2. Check the Console tab for errors
3. Look for any red error messages

### Tasks Not Showing

- Verify your tasks file exists at the configured path
- Check that tasks have the correct format:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Task name due::YYYY-MM-DD eta::HH:MM #tlog/project/section
  ```
- Make sure tasks include your configured task identifier (default: `#tlog`)

## File Structure

After installation, your plugin directory should look like:

```
YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/task-manager/
├── main.js          (generated by build)
├── manifest.json
└── styles.css
```

## Updating the Plugin

To update after making changes:

1. Pull/make changes to the source code
2. Rebuild: `npm run build`
3. Copy `main.js` to your vault's plugin directory (if not using symlink)
4. Reload Obsidian: `Ctrl/Cmd + R`

## Uninstalling

1. Go to Settings → Community Plugins
2. Find "Task Manager" and toggle it off
3. Optionally, delete the plugin directory:
   ```
   YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/task-manager/
   ```
